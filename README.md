## Portfolio - Tommy Robinson

Hi there!  I'm a rising sophomore at Dartmouth College interested in computer and data science. 

#### Skills..
- Python
- Java
- React
- Next.js
- C
- SQL
- Unix
- Pandas
- Git

#### A few relevant courses I've taken...
- QSS 020 Modern Statistical Computing
- CS 50 Software Design and Implementation
- CS 010 Problem Solving: Object Oriented Programming
- ENGS 15.06 Technology Entreprenuership

#### CS Experience...
- [Nerd Apply](nerdapply.com) - Computer Programming Intern - May 2024 - Sept. 2024
  - Redesigned and enhanced front-end features for a successful startup, improving site responsiveness and user interface
  - Utilized React, Next.js, and Firebase to build dynamic, user-friendly components
  
- Dartmouth College Research Assistant - July 2025 - Present
  - Working to maximize efficiency in CSI transmition over Wifi frames between ESP-30 microcontrollers

#### Projects...
- Nuggets Game - C Programming, Network Programming, Systems Design
  - Developed a real-time, multiplayer terminal-based exploration game in C, where players compete to collect gold in a variable map. Designed and implemented  the game server, which handles game state, player movement, and game logic. Supported up to 26 players and spectator views, with full visibility and player interaction logic.

- COVID-19 Impact on Nature Appreciation
  - Conducted analysis on large subset of Tweets from 2020-2022 to investigate the relationship between the COVID-19 Pandemic and people's apprecation of nature.  Used Python, Pandas, VADER Sentiment Analysis, Networx Network Analysis, LDA Topic Modeling, and Matplotlib visulaizations to investigate how appreciation of Nature changed throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic.  Compared trends in different states with different climates and lockdown policies.  Concluded that peak COVID-19 lockdown alligned with peak apprecation of Nature on Twitter.  Additionally, found that less strict COVID-19 policies and warmer climate contributed to greater appreciation of nature on Twitter.
 
Note: In accordance with my school's academic integrity policies and the collaborative nature of these projects, I cannot share the code for the aforementioned projects.
